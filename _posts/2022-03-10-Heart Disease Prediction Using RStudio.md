**In this article, I want to explore in the matter of predicting the heart disease using R Language. I want to know if there are variables 
that are influencing heart disease conditions.  Therefore, I created a project in regards to predicting the heart disease using R Language.**

In this project, the first thing to do is prepare the library that are facilitating me to do the analysis.

## Import the packages

~~~
require(C50)
require(caret)
require(e1071)
require(caTools)
~~~

After importing the packages, we need to import the data that will be used for analysis. We uses heart_dataset.csv which are contains many variables related to heart disease.

## Import the data

~~~
heart <- read.csv(file.choose(),sep=',')
set.seed(1234)
heart$target <- as.factor(heart$target)
vars <- c("trestbps", "chol","thalach")
str(heart[, c(vars, "target")])
~~~

Once you have imporrted the data, split the data into train and test data.

## Split the data

~~~
coba <- sample(1:nrow(heart), size = 250 ,replace=TRUE)
train_data <- heart[ coba,]
test_data  <- heart[-coba,]
~~~

Then, create the model using C5.0 Algorithm.

## Create the model

~~~
mod <- C5.0(x = train_data[,vars],y = train_data$target)
mod
~~~

<br />

Here is the model which has been created.

After that, we need to validate the model to know to find out whether the model made is a good model or not.

## Validate the model

~~~
hasil<- predict(object=mod, newdata=test_data, type="class")
table(hasil, test_data$target)
conf_matrix<-table(hasil, test_data$target)
conf_matrix
akurasi<-round((conf_matrix[1,1]+conf_matrix[2,2])/nrow(test_data),2)*100
akurasi
error_rate<-100-akurasi
error_rate
~~~

<br />

Here are the confusion matrix and the accuracy from the model that has been created.

## Confusion Matrix

## Accuracy

![Accuracy](https://github.com/alvianpratama00/portfolio/blob/master/assets/img/Accuracy.png?raw=true)

**As you can see, This project resulting in an accuracy of 62% which is a fairly low level of accuracy. The accuracy is so small because it uses a categorical variables
with different levels, which tends to decrease the accuracy.**
