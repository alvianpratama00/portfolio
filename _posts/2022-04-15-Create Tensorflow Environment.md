**This is a quick tutorial to show you how to create tensorflow environment in Jupyter Notebook.  I strongly encourage you to install Anaconda before creating the tensorflow environment.**

First of all, open the Anaconda Prompt and run as administrator 
![Admin](https://github.com/alvianpratama00/portfolio/blob/master/assets/img/RunAdmin.png?raw=true)

After that we need to create the tensorflow environment. In this case, I will name it "tf-env".

## Create the environment
~~~
conda create -n tf-env tensorflow
~~~

After that we need to test whether the installation is good or not by activating the tensorflow.


## Activate the environment
~~~
conda activate tf-env
~~~

Then we need to check if the tensorflow already installed or not by writing this code :
~~~
python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.__version__ #
~~~

This is the result when tensorflow is installed :

After all of that, we can continue to the next step, which is creating a kernel to use tensorflow in Jupyter Notebook.
Here is the code to activate the kernel :

## Install the ipykernel
~~~
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
~~~

## Activate the kernel
~~~
python -m ipykernel install --user --name tf-env --display-name "TensorFlow Environment"
~~~

Here is the result if the kernel was installed correctly.

## Additional Information

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a clean installation of Tensorflow in Jupyter Notebook. You will need to install various libraries such as : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc if you want to properly used the Tensorflow.
